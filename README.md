The Lab is a Deliverable

Create an app that uses a search form to show the weather in any city the user searches for.
For example, you can model this project after what we did for the AJAX Movies exercise for the AJAX lesson.
Set this up as a seperate project repo, and push it to your personal GitHub.
Use the Open Weather map to get a forecast and display it on the page.
Create a project folder with the usual setup ... i.e. .html, .css, and .jsfiles in their appropriate sub folders.
If the user searches for another city, make sure the page is only showing ONE city's forecast at a time (i.e. make sure the previous results don't stay on the page).
